OMI: Open Macro Input
http://openmacroinput.com
Welcome to you. 
OMI is a group of toolboxes and software that I am designing to have better control of my games.   
**It can be used for:**
- Improving your game performance
- Custom input that are not fit for a game
- Correct a design flow that the creators did not bother dealing with
- Create additional controllers near your keyboard
- Use Xbox controller on game with only keyboard support
- ...
The list is long. 

Follow the evolution to the project here:

May the code be with you.
Kind regards,
Eloi

What I am doing now ?

# WOW Farming
As wow is kind of dead, I am using it to improve my software OMI because this game is the perfect test-zone for macro.

As Macro lead easily to bot, I code some tools and provide them online free:

## Wow Back to STR

I loved Warcraft as an strategy game. And through macro and multiboxing, I thing there is ways to do a "STR mod" in wow based on free account.

That what I will try to create throw OMI for the community.

NOTE:
I code bots because if it fun and sometime useful to the community.. But I also, I hate bots and report them without hesitation.
